Enrolment Requirements:
This is a limited enrolment program (Type 2L) that can only accommodate a certain number of students. Eligibility is based on the following criteria:
A. Completion of at least 4.0 FCEs including CSC148H1 (with a minimum grade of 70%) and CSC165H1/​CSC240H1 (with a minimum grade of 70%), AND
B. An average of the grades in CSC148H1/​CSC207H1 and CSC165H1/​CSC236H1/​CSC240H1 that meets the department's annual cutoff. When more than one course has been completed from a list of alternatives, the higher grades will be used. Also, CSC240H1 grades will be adjusted to account for the course's greater difficulty. Finally, note that the cutoff changes from year to year, depending on the current capacity of the program and the pool of applicants. For more information, including historical data, please visit http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/ugrad/admission.htm.
Note that students admitted to the program after second or third year will be required to pay retroactive program fees.


Completion Requirements:
(12.0 full course equivalents [FCEs], including at least 1.5 FCEs at the 400-level)
First year (2.5 FCEs):

Notes:
1. Students with a strong background in an object-oriented language such as Python, Java or C++ may omit CSC108H1 and proceed directly with CSC148H1. [There is no need to replace the missing half-credit for program completion; however, please base your course choice on what you are ready to take, not on "saving" a half-credit].
2. CSC240H1 is an accelerated and enriched version of CSC165H1 plus CSC236H1, intended for students with a strong mathematical background, or who develop an interest after taking CSC165H1. If you take CSC240H1 without CSC165H1, there is no need to replace the missing half-credit for program completion; but please see Note 1.
3. Consult the Undergraduate Office for advice about choosing among CSC108H1 and CSC148H1, and between CSC165H1 and CSC240H1.
Later years (6.0 FCEs):
3. CSC369H1, CSC373H1/​CSC375H1

This requirement may also be met by participating in the PEY (Professional Experience Year) program.
Preparing for graduate study in Computer Science
Strong students should consider the option of further study in graduate school (where the degrees offered are typically M.Sc. and Ph.D.). If you find yourself frequently receiving marks in the B+ range or better, you should consult with faculty members to learn more about graduate school and whether it would be a good option for you. You will want to ask for advice on your particular interestsand you will find faculty members are happy to talk to youbut there are also some course choices that should be considered by all students thinking of graduate study in Computer Science.
The focuses can help you further refine your areas of interest, but you should not take courses exclusively in one area. You will benefit by having taken an advanced course requiring considerable software development and a theory course.
It will be especially beneficial to have done a project course (CSC494H1/​CSC495H1), a capstone course (CSC490H1/​CSC491H1), and/or a summer research project. It is good if this individual work is in the area where you eventually decide you'd like to do your own research, but that is not essential; what you need most is some experience doing work on your own, under the mentorship of an experienced researcher.
Choosing courses
This program offers considerable freedom to choose courses at the 300-/400-level, and you are free to make those choices on your own. We are eager to offer guidance, however, and both our Undergraduate Office and individual faculty members are a rich source of advice.

Video game design combines several disciplines within computer science, including software engineering, graphics, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. It also incorporates elements of economics, psychology, music, and creative writing, requiring video game researchers to have a diverse, multidisciplinary set of skills.

Students who wish to pursue video game design should have an understanding of linear algebra (for computer graphics modeling), computer hardware and operating systems (for console architecture), data structures, and algorithm design. Students will gain a general knowledge of the more advanced topics listed in the courses below.

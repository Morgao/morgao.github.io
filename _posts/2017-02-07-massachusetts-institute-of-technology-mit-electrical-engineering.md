General Institute Requirements (GIRs)
The General Institute Requirements include a Communication Requirement that is integrated into both the HASS Requirement and the requirements of each major; see details below.
Summary of Subject Requirements	Subjects
Science Requirement	6
Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement; at least two of these subjects must be designated as communication-intensive (CI-H) to fulfill the Communication Requirement.	8
Restricted Electives in Science and Technology (REST) Requirement [satisfied by 6.002, 6.003, 6.004, or 6.007 and 18.03, 18.05, or 18.600 in the Department Program]	2
Laboratory Requirement (12 units) [satisfied by 6.01, 6.02, or 6.03 in the Departmental Program]	1
Total GIR Subjects Required for SB Degree	17
Physical Education Requirement	
Swimming requirement, plus four physical education courses for eight points.	

Departmental Program
Choose at least two subjects in the major that are designated as communication-intensive (CI-M) to fulfill the Communication Requirement.

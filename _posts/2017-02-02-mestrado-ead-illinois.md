Who is this degree for:
Professionals who want to use big data to understand the world, discover new insights, and optimize their decision-making will find value in the MCS-DS program. Analyzing the rising tide of data has become important to a wide range of fields, including the humanities, medicine, and business, as well as engineering and the sciences. Students will gain a strong foundation that will enable them to bring data science to bear on these areas. The program is designed so that students can complete it at their own pace as they balance their personal and professional commitments. Most students complete the degree in less than three years, though it can be completed in as little as one year or, if needed, as many as five years.

Tuition for the MCS-DS is $600 per credit hour, for a total of $19,200 for the complete 32 credit hour degree. There are additional fees from Coursera, ProctorU, and, depending on the course, Amazon Web Services. Though the department does not have any assistantships or scholarships available for this program, domestic students may qualify for Federal Student Aid, since the MCS-DS is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

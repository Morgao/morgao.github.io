Both CS3216 and CS3217 are 5-MC modules. Students who choose to take CS3216 and CS3217 will count 8-MC towards the Computer Systems Team Project requirement and 2- MC towards Unrestricted Electives. Students must take both CS3216 and CS3217 to complete the Software Engineering Team Project requirement. If a student completed only one of CS3216 and CS3217, he or she has to take another pair of modules to meet the Computer Systems Team Project requirement.
Industrial Experience Requirement
Students will be required to satisfy 12 MCs of Industrial Experience Requirement by doing:
A 6-month internship through CP3880 Advanced Technology Attachment Programme (12 MCs)
Two 3-month internships through CP3200 Internship (6 MCs) and CP3202 Internship II (6MCs). With two internships, the student will be able to experience work in two distinct types of organizations, such as a start-up and a MNC, or in two different industries.
IS4010 Industry Internship Programme (12 MCs) from the IS department.
A 3-month internship through CP3200 Internship (6 MCs) and an approved Industry Course from Computer Science Department (4 MCs). The remaining 2 MCs may be satisfied using Unrestricted Electives. Students should consult the CS Deputy Head (CS Programmes) in advance if they are interested in this option as industry courses may not be offered every year.
iLead or NOC. For students who opt for iLead or NOC, the additional MCs beyond the 12-MCs allocated to Industry Experience Training should be taken from Unrestricted Electives and/or exempted modules.
Other forms of industry experience approved by the Department of Computer Science.
Students with CAP of 4.00 or higher may opt to replace Industry Experience Requirement by CP4101 B.Comp. Dissertation.
Students with CAP of 4.00 or higher after completing at least 70% (i.e. 112 MCs) of the MC requirement for the degree programme may opt to replace the Industry Experience Requirement by CP4101 B.Comp Dissertation (12 MCs). Note that the CP4101 project selection process takes place one semester ahead of the semester in which the students commence CP4101. Thus the students can tentatively select CP4101 projects; but the condition "CAP of 4.00 or higher after completing at least 70% (112 MCs) of the MC requirement for the degree programme" must be satisfied before they can commence CP4101 in lieu of Industry Experience Requirement.

Computer Science Focus Areas for BComp (CS)
CS modules are organised into Focus Areas of coherent modules according to technical areas of study. A CS Focus Area is satisfied by completing 3 modules from the Area Primaries, with at least one module at 4000-level or above. CS Foundation Modules (CFM) that appear in the Area Primaries can be counted as one of the 3 modules towards satisfying a Focus Area. In this case, a student has to read just two other modules in the Area Primaries to satisfy the Focus Area. Elective modules are grouped into the Focus Areas as a guide for indicating their related areas of study. The ten focus areas are listed below. Please click here for details about these focus areas.
Algorithms & Theory
Artificial Intelligence
Computer Graphics and Games
Computer Security
Database Systems
Multimedia Information Retrieval
Networking and Distributed Systems
Parallel Computing

NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) – Computer Science
Students who attended NOC programme may:
count TR3201 Entrepreneurship Practicum (8 MCs) towards CS3882 Breakthrough Ideas for Digital Markets (4 MCs) and one bridging module at 4 MCs. The mapping to bridging module (MA1301/PC1221/PC1222) applies to CS students with A-level or equivalent qualifications in either Mathematics or Physics.  These students replace the missing MCs for the bridging modules with unrestricted electives.  Dummy CS codes CSX3741 and CSX3742 will be issued in place of MA1301 and PC1221/PC1222 respectively.
count TR3202 Start-up Internship Programme (12 MCs) towards Industrial Experience Requirement.
count TR3203 Start-up Case Study and Analysis towards Unrestricted Electives. Students working on computer systems term projects for TR3203 may seek approval to instead take TR3203P, which counts towards CS3201/2 Software Engineering Project I/II or equivalent pairs.  Alternatively, TR3203 can be mapped to TR3203E in which 8 MCs of CS-coded electives at level-3000 can be considered for the fulfilment of CS Breadth and Depth Requirements.

University Scholars Programme (Computer Science)
Students in the University Scholars Programme who choose the Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) major will follow the Computer Science programme, but with the following variations:
They will read GER1000 Quantitative Reasoning (4 MCs) as compulsory module for the University Level Requirements (ULR). The remaining 16 MCs in ULR are replaced by the 3 USP Inquiry Modules and 1 USP Foundation module ( i.e. University Scholars Seminar).
They will not be required to read CS2101 Effective Communication for Computing Professionals. It is replaced by USP Foundation module: Writing and Critical Thinking
They will not be required to read one Science Module (4 MCs). It is replaced by 1 USP Inquiry module in Sciences and Technologies basket.
They will read CS3201 and CS3202 or other modules approved by the Department of Computer Science as independent study modules (ISMs) which will also be counted as 2 USP Inquiry modules in Sciences and Technologies basket.
